# Product Requirements Document: Dub.co to Laravel Migration

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the comprehensive migration of Dub.co's architecture from Next.js to Laravel + React + Inertia.js, maintaining functional and visual parity while adapting to our chosen technology stack. The migration follows a **backend-first approach** with systematic component migration from the reference implementation at `/Users/yasinboelhouwer/shorts/dub-main/`.

## Project Overview

### Objective
Migrate the entire Dub.co platform to Laravel + React + Inertia.js while maintaining:
- **Functional Parity**: All features and capabilities from the original
- **Visual Consistency**: Exact UI/UX matching dub-main design patterns
- **Performance Standards**: Equivalent or improved performance metrics
- **Scalability**: Support for 100M+ clicks and 2M+ links monthly

### Technology Stack Migration
| Component | From (Dub.co) | To (Our Stack) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Backend Framework | Next.js API Routes | Laravel 11+ |
| Frontend Framework | Next.js + React | React 18+ + Inertia.js |
| Database ORM | Prisma | Laravel Eloquent |
| Authentication | NextAuth.js | Laravel Sanctum |
| Queue System | QStash (Upstash) | Laravel Horizon |
| Caching | Upstash Redis | Laravel Cache + Redis |
| Email | Resend | Laravel Mail |
| File Storage | Vercel Blob | Laravel Storage |
